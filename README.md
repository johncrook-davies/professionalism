#### Making an impact
Total video length 10:31 + 17:42 = 28:12
* Raises issues relating to a young professional in a position of high responsibility
* One issue relates to a relaying bad news to senior management - the main character was correct in checking the inputs to his work and was correct in raising the issue, he may have to blow the whistle if senior management ignore his advice
* The main character presents to the board regarding implementation of an accounting standard, the board is reluctant to fund the development
* The presentation may have been too technical, it might have been better to go more high level
* If the required work is beyond the professionals skills/knowledge, then he should undertake training to develop those skills and/or find a professional who does have the required experience
* One of the heads of avoided questions through small talk
* One of the professional's employees did not want to progress through the exams and did not want to progress through the organisation
* This employee was preventing some in the team from taking study leave citing work requirements
* If this is because of genuine work requirements then this might be acceptable
* There might be some compromise here that can be implemented
#### New boss new approach
Total video length 06:01 + 12:42 = 18:43
* Raises issues relating to working with sparse data and changes of approach from management
* It appears the main character in the scenario may have become complacent
* Things change over time and it appears from the video that she may not have moved on with the environment
* The change of management has brought new idea and instead of embracing the new way of working, the main character is reacting negatively to this
* There is a personal element to this too as there may have been very little effort to integrate her new boss
* Her new manager has not been brought along for the journey with the report
* For the chief actuary, some of his remarks are not respectful but perhaps valid
* This could be addressed by an honest conversation or a feedback session
* If the work was substandard and the impact was serious it may be necessary for the main character to speak up
#### Heated discussion
Total video length 07:24 + 09:30 = 16:54
* Video raises issues relating to interactions with the media in relation to an IFOA risk alert on climate change
* The non-executive director keeps getting cut off by the senior actuary
* The senior actuary raises some interesting points
* The two professionals are faced with tricky questions as they advise schemes that invest in petrochemical companies
* The two professionals disagree on
* Professionals must be clear on who they are representing when speaking to the media
* Individuals must liaise with comms departments
* It is usually necessary to undergo media training
* When representing personal views this must be very clear
* Make sure you are well prepared for interviews with stats and key messages clear
* Try not to get drawn into creating controversial headlines - prepare in advance, be aware about what is being recorded

### Asia conference 2019 Key Note: Dr Moses Cheng
Total video length 01:06:15
* The lecture subject focussed on building for the the future in the region, addressing also how regulation can affect this
* Problems have traditionally been addressed by increased rules and regulation
* The question is whether this actually addresses the underlying issues
* Insurance requires effective laws and regulation
* Laws and regulation are not however a solution to every problem
* More than a minimum standard is required for a successful society
* Regulation can sometimes undermine the clarity of the law and can become so complex that they become practically difficult to adhere to
* Innovation and competition can also be stiffled by regulation
* Regulations and laws must be properly enforced to be effective
* Industries can only remain respected and therefore grow if it remains professional, maintains good standards and ethics
* Professionalism in that territory is being built with education, technical training and structured CPD
* Stretching the rules can often breach good ethics and in the past such behaviours have led to significant failures that have harmed society
* Professionalism means integrity, embracing change and being mindful of the wider society and environment when making decisions
