# Continuous Professional Development (CPD) professionalism notes

## 2020/21 year
### PST 2020/21 Professionalism in uncertainty
#### Making an impact
Total video length 10:31 + 17:42 = 28:12
* Raises issues relating to a young professional in a position of high responsibility
* One issue relates to a relaying bad news to senior management - the main character was correct in checking the inputs to his work and was correct in raising the issue, he may have to blow the whistle if senior management ignore his advice
* The main character presents to the board regarding implementation of an accounting standard, the board is reluctant to fund the development
* The presentation may have been too technical, it might have been better to go more high level
* If the required work is beyond the professionals skills/knowledge, then he should undertake training to develop those skills and/or find a professional who does have the required experience
* One of the heads of avoided questions through small talk
* One of the professional's employees did not want to progress through the exams and did not want to progress through the organisation
* This employee was preventing some in the team from taking study leave citing work requirements
* If this is because of genuine work requirements then this might be acceptable
* There might be some compromise here that can be implemented
#### New boss new approach
Total video length 06:01 + 12:42 = 18:43
* Raises issues relating to working with sparse data and changes of approach from management
* It appears the main character in the scenario may have become complacent
* Things change over time and it appears from the video that she may not have moved on with the environment
* The change of management has brought new idea and instead of embracing the new way of working, the main character is reacting negatively to this
* There is a personal element to this too as there may have been very little effort to integrate her new boss
* Her new manager has not been brought along for the journey with the report
* For the chief actuary, some of his remarks are not respectful but perhaps valid
* This could be addressed by an honest conversation or a feedback session
* If the work was substandard and the impact was serious it may be necessary for the main character to speak up
#### Heated discussion
Total video length 07:24 + 09:30 = 16:54
* Video raises issues relating to interactions with the media in relation to an IFOA risk alert on climate change
* The non-executive director keeps getting cut off by the senior actuary
* The senior actuary raises some interesting points
* The two professionals are faced with tricky questions as they advise schemes that invest in petrochemical companies
* The two professionals disagree on
* Professionals must be clear on who they are representing when speaking to the media
* Individuals must liaise with comms departments
* It is usually necessary to undergo media training
* When representing personal views this must be very clear
* Make sure you are well prepared for interviews with stats and key messages clear
* Try not to get drawn into creating controversial headlines - prepare in advance, be aware about what is being recorded
* Comms teams can help source reliable stats
#### Partner in a pickle
Total video length 01:39
* Video addresses confidentiality agreements
* The nature of these agreements varies widely and can cover many restrictions
* Its always advisable to get legal advice in advance of signing long tailed clauses
### Asia conference 2019 Key Note: Dr Moses Cheng
Total video length 01:06:15
* The lecture subject focussed on building for the the future in the region, addressing also how regulation can affect this
* Problems have traditionally been addressed by increased rules and regulation
* The question is whether this actually addresses the underlying issues
* Insurance requires effective laws and regulation
* Laws and regulation are not however a solution to every problem
* More than a minimum standard is required for a successful society
* Regulation can sometimes undermine the clarity of the law and can become so complex that they become practically difficult to adhere to
* Innovation and competition can also be stiffled by regulation
* Regulations and laws must be properly enforced to be effective
* Industries can only remain respected and therefore grow if it remains professional, maintains good standards and ethics
* Professionalism in that territory is being built with education, technical training and structured CPD
* Stretching the rules can often breach good ethics and in the past such behaviours have led to significant failures that have harmed society
* Professionalism means integrity, embracing change and being mindful of the wider society and environment when making decisions

## 2021/22 year
### PST 2021/22 Strictly professional
#### Boss' best buddy
Total video length 7:53 + 20:53 = 28:46
* Raises issues relating to socialisation at work and favouritism
* Addresses professionalism issues around social media
* There's a lot of gossip around Michael's relationsip with the boss Sophia
* There could well be a favouritism issue
* There is nothing unprofessional about having a social relationship with a senior figure
* It is always important to maintain impartiality however
* Any concerns can be raised in the right way in an objective discussion
* Important that concerns are evidence based
* Speaking up principle is important here
* From Sophia's perspective - more effort could have been made to avoid the appearance of favouritism
* Permission is important when posting on social media
* Social media posts should also be respectful and professional
#### Data - what data?!
Total video lenght 7:02 + 14:25 =  21:27
* Raises issues relating to large complex projects relying on many sources of imperfect data
* There are resourcing issues, issues working internationally and concerns around caveats
* With enough caveats results can become meaningless
* The intentions for the information are unknown and this can be risky
* Trust in senior management is an issue here
* It's important here for Aalia to speak to stakeholders more widely here to better understand intentions for the data here and whether the accuracy of her work is suitable
* The uncertainty in Aalia's work should be made clear and visible
* Escalation may be necessary here depending on the specifics of the situation
#### Judgement day
Total video length 8:17 + 17:01 = 25:18
* Raises issues around transfer values in a low interest rate environment
* Also addresses issues around changing scheme rules
* In the video Rhiannon communicates commutation factors should increase from 15/1 to 19/1
* There are issues here around fairness between scheme members and the company's management
* There are difficulties in communication here because transfer value factors appear similar to commutation factors but are very different because one includes a reversionary component and the other does not
* Rhiannon could have explained the issue without refering to technical language
* There are many techniques to convey technical concepts in a simple way
* Its important when explaining concepts to be specific and accurate in the language that you use
* It's important to prepare properly for meetings with clients to ensure that the important concepts are communicated clearly
#### The Pitch
Total video length 9:23 + 20:26 = 29:49
* Arthur clearly hasn't prepared very well for the meeting as he's not sure who he's meeting with
* Arthur is displaying some severe unconscious bias
* At times Arthur is behaving outright racist and ageist
* None of this is acceptable in any context nonetheless a professional context
* The presentation Arthur is to deliver is copy and pasted and not specific to the business' needs so potentially inappropriate
* It's always very important to correct unconscious bias and discrimination
* Introductions are important in meetings with unfamiliar parties
* When speaking up for others however it is important to check first with the person what they would want
